# Group Project: UnBore ME!
***
This Coding Bootcamp group project is called, **UnBore Me**. **UnBore Me** is a website which searches thousands of events in a given area, ranging from festivals to concerts. **UnBore Me** is for anyone who is bored and wants to know what events are happening in their area.

A user simply specifies an event category, location and radius and **UnBore Me** will populate with event cards for the given place and category. Each event card holds broad event information and provides buttons for a Google Map view of the event, Facebook sharing and detailed event information.


## Logistics
***
- **UnBore Me** uses two API's, one for Google Maps and one for events from Eventful.
- Event cards are dynamically built and inserted using Javascript.
- Google maps are displayed in modals and re-initialized with every map button click.
- Firebase is used to track which is the top searched category.
- Front-end is styled with Zurb Foundation and custom CSS.
